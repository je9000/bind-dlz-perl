dlz_perl_driver

ABOUT

dlz_perl_driver is a BIND DLZ plugin to allow BIND to run Perl modules to
answer DNS queries. This plugin relies on functionality provided by BIND
9.9.0 and above and utilizes the BIND DLZ dlopen() API.

COMPILING

dlz_perl_driver has been tested and builds on Linux and FreeBSD, 32- and 64-
bit. Perl is required to build dlz_perl_driver but the BIND source code is
not.

USAGE

Included is a sample named.conf file that will load the sample Perl module
and use it to answer queries. See the named.conf.example and
dlz_perl_example.pm for details, these files should work as is (assuming the
module is compiled and placed in the location specified in named.conf.example)
and should provide enough information to get started.

Perl modules are free to warn and die as usual, but a callback is also provided
that allows the module to log to the same logfile as BIND itself. A callback is
also provided to allow Perl modules to access client information such as source
IP and port. These callback APIs can be a little complicated so please see the
example Perl module for usage.
